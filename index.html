       Hi, I'm Jansen Padilla. I am in the class of 2026 at Waipahu highschool. In Waipahu highschool I am in the academy of Industrial and Engineering Technology. I am in the cybersecurity Pathway. School has taught me many things like how to critcally think and gave me strong problem solving skills. Outside of school the things I enjoy are playing video games, Hanging out with my friends and, hanging out with my familly. I would like to say I am a very family oriented person I get along well with all my family members. As I look at the future I would like to learn more from diffrent types of people. I believe that there is always something new to learn and always look fowrad to learn as much as I can. Welcome to my electronic portfolio hope you can learn more about me.
